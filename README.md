 About me:
  1. I am learning to code with my mates so that our wives would not understand our language. Only to find out our wives have started skills bootcamp too.
  2. I am a Nurse.
  3. Movie lines can keep me motivated. As Mr. Miyagi said: >â€œA man who can catch a fly with chopsticks can accomplish anything."
