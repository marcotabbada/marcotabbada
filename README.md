I have been a Registered Nurse since year 2006. I specialize in Oncology and Haematology. This job is fulfilling but I wish to learn new skills outside of nursing. Hence, I joined the Skills Bootcamp for Software Engineer. 
I find the training to be challenging, yet extremely satisfying.  

I am currently learning Python and I am hoping to land a job in the tech industry.
